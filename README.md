# Timed_Quiz

## Description

A quiz that showcases javascript! In this quiz you are timed and it starts at 60 seconds and counts down every second. If the user gets and answer wrong the time is dropped another 10 seconds! Once the user is done or the time runs out they are taken to the summery page that shows their score and askes for their initials.  

These values are recorded in the local storage and rendered on the highscore page! Even if the user closes out of the browser the information is still there and will render on the high score page when viewed.
